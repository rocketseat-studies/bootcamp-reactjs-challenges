# Challenge Module-01

This is the **first bootcamp challenge**. Where this challenge was developed a **Facebook-style posts feed**. During development, it was necessary to **develop the components, their styles and configure the ReactJS framework from scratch with the following tools:**

- Babel
- Webpack
- Webpack Dev Server
- ESLint
- EditorConfig
- Prettier

# Rules

- The **Header** must be a **separate component**;
- The **Post** must be a **separate component**;
- The **post header** where the **avatar, name and time** of the post is on a **separate side called PostHeader**;
- **Posts** must be **stored in the state (state)** of the main `App.js` file;
- You must **pass an information as a single post to the Post component** when you perform the `map` in the **post state**;

# Starting

Before cloning the project, make sure you have all the tried and tested technologies below.

**Prerequisites**

- [NODEJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [YARN](https://yarnpkg.com/pt-BR/)

After all the technologies above installed and with their proper configurations, it is time to clone the project and follow the steps below.

**Installing the Modules**

```
$ yarn install
```

This command will install all existing dependencies in the `package.json` file and the `node_modules` directory will be created along with all the modules within it.

# Running the Project

**Runs the app in the development mode**. I have already set up the execution script, just be in the **root folder of the project** and **type the following command** in your **cmd/terminal**:

`yarn dev`
or
`npm run dev`
