# Challenge Module-02

This is the **second bootcamp challenge **. Where in this challenge, from the user input is consumed in the Github API the given repository. Only two repositories are allowed for comparison.

During development, it was necessary to **develop the components, their styles, create services for consumption of API and armanzemento in LocalStorage, and use the MomentJS library for converting dates from scratch with the following tools:**

- npx create-react-app
- styled-components
- props and PropTypes
- Axios
- LocalStorage
- MomentJS

This module has not applied refactoring techniques, code organization, or anything, so do not worry if the code is a little messy.

# Rules

- **Store** the list of repositories added to the `localStorage`;
- **Create a button** in each repository to delete it from the listing and remove it from the
  `localStorage` as well;
- **Create a button** in each repository to update your data for the new ones. Information for stars, forks, last commit, etc;

**In this module I did not apply refactoring techniques, code organization or even UX / UI, so do not worry. This module is more functional than visual design, design patterns etc.**
